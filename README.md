# Project 3: Use Deep Learning to Clone Driving Behavior

The original read me before I forked the project can be found [here](README_original.md).

The git repository files required for the project are noted below.

  - [model.py](model.py) - script used to create and train the model
  - [drive.py](drive.py) - script used to drive the car
  - [model.h5](model.h5) - the trained Keras model
  - the report writeup file in [markdown](writeup_report.md) or [pdf](writeup_report.pdf)
